# Using Paytm Checkout and Flask
Integrate Paytm Checkout to your Python Flask website to provide a secure, PCI-compliant way to accept Debit/Credit card, Net-Banking, UPI and Paytm wallet payments from your customers.

# Setup steps
Youâ€™ll need to have the following prerequisites before we go any further:
- A [Paytm](https://business.paytm.com/) account
- A [Python](http://www.python.org/) environment

### 1. Basic app setup
```bash
# clone this repo from github
git clone https://github.com/abhimskywalker/flask_paytm_checkout.git
# navigative into the folder
cd flask_paytm_checkout
# install the requirements
pip install flask
pip install requests
easy_install pycrypto
```

### 2. Get merhcant credentials
- Go to https://dashboard.paytm.com/next/apikeys and copy the test and/or production API details
- Replace the variables in `app.py`

### 3. Run the flask app
```bash
# run the flask app
FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run
```
- Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000
- It will show the params that will be sent to Paytm server to initiate checkout flow includeing callback url (More detailed understanding availabel at: https://developer.paytm.com/docs/v1/payment-gateway )
- Once the transaction is done you will be redirected to http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback with checkout response params and then transaction verification API response params.
